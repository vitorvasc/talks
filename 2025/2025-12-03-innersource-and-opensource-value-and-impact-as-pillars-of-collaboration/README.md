## 📌 Abstract

This talk introduces how InnerSource practices inside organizations can prepare
teams to contribute effectively to open source. We discuss why contribution
matters, using Mercado Libre’s reliance on critical open source components and
the risks of maintaining internal forks. The session highlights the value and
impact of contributing upstream—improving developer experience, reducing
long-term costs, and influencing project roadmaps.

Using examples from the OpenTelemetry community and contributor journeys, we
show how small, consistent contributions compound over time. The talk closes
with practical steps for getting started, including finding first issues,
joining community channels, and building collaboration habits internally before
contributing externally.
