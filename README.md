# Talks by Vitor Vasconcellos

Hi there! 👋🏼

I'm Vitor Vasconcellos, a Brazilian software engineer who loves building
reliable, observable systems and making complex things click.

At [Mercado Libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercado_Libre), I'm part of the
Observability Team, where I help design and scale our company-wide distributed
tracing platform using OpenTelemetry. This platform supports some of the most
critical business flows in Latin America, where failures mean real impact for
millions of users. Recent work includes correlating business identifiers with
telemetry data and operating a high-throughput ClickHouse schema capable of
handling hundreds of billions of inserts per day while still enabling fast,
trace-level debugging.

I'm also an active contributor to [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/),
serving as a maintainer for the Communications SIG and the Portuguese
localization efforts, helping grow the community, make observability more
accessible, and advocate for developers to adopt it as a core practice.

Always curious, always learning — and always excited to share what I've been
building.
